# Earthquake Leaflet
In this project, I used Leaflet to map earthquake data from earthquake.usgs.gov. For the markers, I used varying colors to indicate the magnitude of the  earthquakes (earthquakes with magnitudes of less than 3 are in green and with magnitudes of less than 3 are in green, earthquakes with magnitudes of between 3 and 4 are in yellow and earthquakes with magnitudes greater than 4 are in red). Also the circle size was dictated by earthquake depth, with smaller circles indicating shalllower earthquakes. Whe you click on a specific earthquake, it pulls up a tooltip, with the location and magnitude of the earthquake.
